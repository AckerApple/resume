OBJECTIVE:
To apply my advanced knowledge and experience in software engineering at a stimulating and rewarding organization. To work with a team where my skills can be effectively utilized to improve the operations, reliability and efficiency of a company.

PASSION:
I maintain popular open source code packages for several different programming platforms including NPM. My publicly available code receives free quality assurance by adopters whom make pull requests and also report issues. This has led to communications and collaborations with other advanced developers from around the world. Open source authoring has been a very enriching rewarding experience that I would like continue.

Worked with team of programmers that all had varying skills and abilities. I used Angular for frontend technologies to develop desktop and mobile administrative apps.

Highlights of Achievements:
- Utilized open source architectures to run reliable consistent
applications across all major devices and web browsers.
